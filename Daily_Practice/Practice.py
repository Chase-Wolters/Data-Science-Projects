# new py file to practice script writing
# this script will use dictionaries to convert letters in a word into there alphanumeric word
# potential use cases: police can scan a license plate and instead of needing to read it out and potentially have an error,
# the computer will translate it. 
# however, upon typing this I realized if a cop can get a picture of the liscence plate, then they dont need the alphanumeric code 

alphanumberic = { 'a': 'alpha', 'b': 'bravo', 'c': 'charlie', 'd': 'delta'}
